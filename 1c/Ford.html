    <p>The new Ford SUV will share its platform, engines, and several other components with its Mahindra sibling but it will carry a distinctly different design and appeal.</p>
    <p>While the next gen XUV500 would be primarily styled by Mahindra Group’s subsidiary Pininfarina.</p>
    <p>The new Ford’s styling language is expected to be inspired by the immensely popular F150 pick-up truck.</p>
