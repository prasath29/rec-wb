    <p>This legendary brand finds its roots in Henry Royce's electrical and mechanical business, which started in 1884 and went on to become a car manufacturing company in 1906. 
        Royce made his first car in 1904, and was soon introduced to Charles Rolls, a proprietor of a car dealership.</p>
